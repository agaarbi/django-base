# django-base
This repo can be used as base for different django and drf projects. Branch name will give the basic idea about the stage of the code.

1. base-01: django project (no drf yet), only core (no apps yet), settings with .env file, postgres as db
2. base-02: accounts app with django recommended custom user pass, no migrations run so far
3. base-03: django custom model full example
